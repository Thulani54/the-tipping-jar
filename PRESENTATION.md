# The Tipping Jar — Platform Presentation

---

## Slide 1 · Title

**The Tipping Jar**
*Empowering Creators to Earn Consistently*

> A creator monetisation platform built for South Africa — powered by Paystack, priced in ZAR.

---

## Slide 2 · The Problem

Creators across South Africa face three compounding challenges:

- **Inconsistent income** — one viral post doesn't pay rent
- **No local payment layer** — most platforms charge in USD, Stripe isn't available in SA
- **Fans want to help but have no easy way to** — likes don't pay for studio time

> There is no ZAR-native, creator-first monetisation platform in the South African market.

---

## Slide 3 · What Is The Tipping Jar?

The Tipping Jar is a **full-stack creator monetisation platform** that lets fans support South African creators with real money — instantly, in Rands, without friction.

- Built on **Paystack** — the payment infrastructure of Africa
- **ZAR-native** — no currency conversion, no international fees
- Works for **musicians, artists, podcasters, writers, streamers, coaches** — anyone with an audience
- Three roles: **Creator · Fan · Enterprise**

## Slide 8 · Business Model

```
Creator earns: ~94% of every transaction
Platform fee:   3% (TippingJar revenue)
Service fee:    3% (Paystack processing)
```

- **No monthly fee for creators** — we only earn when they do
- **Enterprise tier** — premium plans for agencies and teams managing multiple creators
- **API access** — developer-tier pricing for integrations
- Sustainable: as creator revenue grows, so does ours — perfectly aligned incentives

---

## Slide 9 · Tip Streaks & Badges — Retention Engine

Fans who tip the same creator in consecutive months earn:

| Streak | Badge |
|---|---|
| 2 months | 🔥 Two-Month Supporter |
| 3 months | 🔥🔥 Quarter Streak |
| 6 months | 💎 Six-Month Loyal |
| 12 months | 👑 Year-Round Champion |

**Why this matters:**
- Turns one-time tippers into habitual supporters
- Creators can shout out top streak holders
- Drives 30-60% higher repeat tip rates (gamification effect)
